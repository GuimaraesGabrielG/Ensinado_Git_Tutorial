# MOTIVATION:

The creation of the site is motivated to teach people how to use git in the best way in their day-to-day. There are many websites that teach, however they show commands that you will not use.

I show each command in a succinct and explanatory way, drawing attention to how and when to use it.

Hope this helps :)
